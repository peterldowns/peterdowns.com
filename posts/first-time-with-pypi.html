      <div class="post"><h1>How to submit a package to PyPI</h1>
<hr>
<p>The other month a coworker of mine wanted to distribute
<a href="http://PyPI.python.org/PyPI/locu/0.1">a small wrapper</a>
he'd written for the <a href="http://dev.locu.com/">Locu API</a>.
Instead of forcing developers to clone his repository, he
wanted them to be able install with a single command:
<code>pip install locu</code>. He wasn't sure how to go about this so
I wrote up a quick guide, which I'm publishing below
because I haven't found any other guides for this particular
use case (python library hosted on github).</p>
<h2>What is <a href="http://pypi.python.org">PyPI</a>?</h2>
<p>From the official website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>PyPI</strong> &#8212; the Python Package Index</p>
<p>The Python Package Index is a repository of software for the
Python programming language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Written something cool? Want others to be able to install it with
<code>easy_install</code> or <code>pip</code>? Put your code on PyPI. It's a big list of
python packages that you absolutely <em>must</em> submit your package to
for it to be easily one-line installable.</p>
<p>The good news is that submitting to PyPI is simple in theory:
just sign up and upload your code, all for free. The bad news
is that in practice it's a little bit more complicated than that.
The <em>other</em> good news is that I've written this guide, and that
if you're stuck, you can always refer to
<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/CheeseShopTutorial#Submitting_Packages_to_the_Package_Index">the official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I've written this guide with the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The module/library/package that you're submitting is called <code>mypackage</code>.</li>
<li><code>mypackage</code> is hosted on <a href="http://github.com">github</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Create your accounts</h3>
<p>On <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form">PyPI Live</a> and also
on <a href="http://testpypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form">PyPI Test</a>. You must create an
account in order to be able to upload your code. I recommend using the same email/password for
both accounts, just to make your life easier when it comes time to push.</p>
<h3>Create a <code>.pypirc</code> configuration file</h3>
<p>This file holds your information for authenticating with PyPI, both the live and the test versions.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[distutils]</span>
<span class="na">index-servers</span> <span class="o">=</span><span class="s"></span>
<span class="s">  pypi</span>
<span class="s">  pypitest</span>

<span class="k">[pypi]</span>
<span class="na">repository</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">https://pypi.python.org/pypi</span>
<span class="na">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">your_username</span>
<span class="na">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">your_password</span>

<span class="k">[pypitest]</span>
<span class="na">repository</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">https://testpypi.python.org/pypi</span>
<span class="na">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">your_username</span>
<span class="na">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">your_password</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is just to make your life easier, so that when it comes time to upload you
don't have to type/remember your username and password. Make sure to put this
file in your home folder &#8211;&#160;its path should be <code>~/.pypirc</code>.</p>
<p>Because this file holds your username and password, you may want to change its permissions so that only you can read and write it. From the terminal, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>chmod <span class="m">600</span> ~/.pypirc
</pre></div>


<p>Thanks to <a href="http://schobert.cc/">Martin Schobert</a> for the recommendation.</p>
<h5>Notes on passwords / usernames</h5>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/michielsikma/status/632410926621200388">Michiel Sikma</a> has
reported that in Python 3 if your password includes a raw <code>%</code>, it needs to be
escaped by doubling &#8211; the .pypirc config parser <a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/bugs/1109196">interpolates
strings</a>. For
example, if your password is <code>hello%world</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[pypi]</span>
<span class="na">repository</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">https://pypi.python.org/pypi</span>
<span class="na">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">myusername</span>
<span class="na">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">hello%%world</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I've never run into this issue, but if you're having trouble this might help.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jamesstidard">James Stidard</a> has reported that this escaping
behavior has been patched and is no longer necessary. If you're seeing an error
with a response code of <code>403: Invalid or non-existent authentication
information</code>, try un-escaping the percent signs in your password.</p>
<p><a href="http://amfarrell.com/">Andrew Farrell</a> points out that if your password includes spaces, make sure not to quote it. For example, if your password is <code>correct horse battery staple</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[pypi]</span>
<span class="na">repository</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">https://pypi.python.org/pypi</span>
<span class="na">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">myusername</span>
<span class="na">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">correct horse battery staple</span>
</pre></div>


<p><em>Thanks to Michiel, Andrew, and <a href="https://twitter.com/c_hack">Charlie Hack</a> for their help with this section.</em></p>
<h3>Prepare your package</h3>
<p>Every package on PyPI needs to have a file called <code>setup.py</code> at
the root of the directory. If your'e using a markdown-formatted read me file
you'll also need a <code>setup.cfg</code> file. Also, you'll want a <code>LICENSE.txt</code> file
describing what can be done with your code. So if I've been working on a
library called <code>mypackage</code>,  my directory structure would look like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>root-dir/   # arbitrary working directory name
  setup.py
  setup.cfg
  LICENSE.txt
  README.md
  mypackage/
    __init__.py
    foo.py
    bar.py
    baz.py
</pre></div>


<p>Here's a breakdown of what goes in which file:</p>
<h4>setup.py</h4>
<p>This is metadata about your library.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">distutils.core</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">setup</span>
<span class="n">setup</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'mypackage'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">packages</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'mypackage'</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="c1"># this must be the same as the name above</span>
  <span class="n">version</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'0.1'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">description</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'A random test lib'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">author</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Peter Downs'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">author_email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'peterldowns@gmail.com'</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'https://github.com/peterldowns/mypackage'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1"># use the URL to the github repo</span>
  <span class="n">download_url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'https://github.com/peterldowns/mypackage/archive/0.1.tar.gz'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1"># I'll explain this in a second</span>
  <span class="n">keywords</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'testing'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'logging'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'example'</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="c1"># arbitrary keywords</span>
  <span class="n">classifiers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[],</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>download_url</code> is a link to a hosted file with your repository's code.
Github will host this for you, but only if you
create a <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging"><code>git tag</code></a>. In your
repository, type: <code>git tag 0.1 -m "Adds a
tag so that we can put this on PyPI."</code>. Then, type <code>git tag</code> to show a
list of tags &#8212; you should see <code>0.1</code> in the list. Type <code>git push --tags origin
master</code> to update your code on Github with the latest tag information. Github
creates tarballs for download at <code>https://github.com/{username}/{module_name}/archive/{tag}.tar.gz</code>.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/larsblumberg">Lars Blumberg</a> for writing in about Github's current archive URL scheme.</em></p>
<h4>setup.cfg</h4>
<p>This tells PyPI where your README file is.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[metadata]</span>
<span class="na">description-file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">README.md</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is necessary if you're using a markdown readme file. At upload time, you
may still get some errors about the lack of a readme &#8212; don't worry about it.
If you don't <strong>have</strong> to use a markdown README file, I would recommend using
<a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html">reStructuredText (REST)</a> instead.</p>
<h4>LICENSE.txt</h4>
<p>This file will contain whichver license you want your code to have. I tend to
use the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>.</p>
<h3>Upload your package to PyPI Test</h3>
<p>Run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>python setup.py register -r pypitest
</pre></div>


<p>This will attempt to register your package against PyPI's test server, just to make sure you've
set up everything correctly.</p>
<p>Then, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>python setup.py sdist upload -r pypitest
</pre></div>


<p>You should get no errors, and should also now be able to see your library in the
<a href="https://testpypi.python.org/pypi">test PyPI repository</a>.</p>
<h3>Upload to PyPI Live</h3>
<p>Once you've successfully uploaded to PyPI Test, perform the same steps but point to
the live PyPI server instead. To register, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>python setup.py register -r pypi
</pre></div>


<p>Then, run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi
</pre></div>


<p>and you're done! Congratulations on successfully publishing your first package!</p></div>
