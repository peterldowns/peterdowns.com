# How to submit a package to PyPI
-------------------------------

The other month a coworker of mine wanted to distribute
[a small wrapper](http://PyPI.python.org/PyPI/locu/0.1)
he'd written for the [Locu API](http://dev.locu.com/).
Instead of forcing developers to clone his repository, he
wanted them to be able install with a single command:
`pip install locu`. He wasn't sure how to go about this so
I wrote up a quick guide, which I'm publishing below
because I haven't found any other guides for this particular
use case (python library hosted on github).

## What is [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org)?

From the official website:

> **PyPI** — the Python Package Index
> 
> The Python Package Index is a repository of software for the
> Python programming language.

Written something cool? Want others to be able to install it with
`easy_install` or `pip`? Put your code on PyPI. It's a big list of
python packages that you absolutely *must* submit your package to
for it to be easily one-line installable.


The good news is that submitting to PyPI is simple in theory:
just sign up and upload your code, all for free. The bad news
is that in practice it's a little bit more complicated than that.
The *other* good news is that I've written this guide, and that
if you're stuck, you can always refer to
[the official documentation](http://wiki.python.org/moin/CheeseShopTutorial#Submitting_Packages_to_the_Package_Index).

I've written this guide with the following assumptions:

* The module/library/package that you're submitting is called `mypackage`.
* `mypackage` is hosted on [github](http://github.com).

### Create your accounts

On [PyPI Live](http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form) and also
on [PyPI Test](http://testpypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form). You must create an
account in order to be able to upload your code. I recommend using the same email/password for
both accounts, just to make your life easier when it comes time to push.

### Create a `.pypirc` configuration file

This file holds your information for authenticating with PyPI, both the live and the test versions.

```ini
[distutils]
index-servers =
  pypi
  pypitest

[pypi]
repository=https://pypi.python.org/pypi
username=your_username
password=your_password

[pypitest]
repository=https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
username=your_username
password=your_password
```

This is just to make your life easier, so that when it comes time to upload you
don't have to type/remember your username and password. Make sure to put this
file in your home folder – its path should be `~/.pypirc`.

Because this file holds your username and password, you may want to change its permissions so that only you can read and write it. From the terminal, run:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.pypirc
```

Thanks to [Martin Schobert](http://schobert.cc/) for the recommendation.

##### Notes on passwords / usernames

[Michiel Sikma](https://twitter.com/michielsikma/status/632410926621200388) has
reported that in Python 3 if your password includes a raw `%`, it needs to be
escaped by doubling – the .pypirc config parser [interpolates
strings](http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/bugs/1109196). For
example, if your password is `hello%world`:

```ini
[pypi]
repository=https://pypi.python.org/pypi
username=myusername
password=hello%%world
```

I've never run into this issue, but if you're having trouble this might help.

[James Stidard](https://github.com/jamesstidard) has reported that this escaping
behavior has been patched and is no longer necessary. If you're seeing an error
with a response code of `403: Invalid or non-existent authentication
information`, try un-escaping the percent signs in your password.


[Andrew Farrell](http://amfarrell.com/) points out that if your password includes spaces, make sure not to quote it. For example, if your password is `correct horse battery staple`:

```ini
[pypi]
repository=https://pypi.python.org/pypi
username=myusername
password=correct horse battery staple
```

### Prepare your package

Every package on PyPI needs to have a file called `setup.py` at
the root of the directory. If your'e using a markdown-formatted read me file
you'll also need a `setup.cfg` file. Also, you'll want a `LICENSE.txt` file
describing what can be done with your code. So if I've been working on a
library called `mypackage`,  my directory structure would look like this:


    root-dir/ 	# arbitrary working directory name
      setup.py
      setup.cfg
      LICENSE.txt
      README.md
      mypackage/
        __init__.py
        foo.py
        bar.py
        baz.py

Here's a breakdown of what goes in which file:

#### setup.py

This is metadata about your library.

    from distutils.core import setup
    setup(
      name = 'mypackage',
      packages = ['mypackage'], # this must be the same as the name above
      version = '0.1',
      description = 'A random test lib',
      author = 'Peter Downs',
      author_email = 'peterldowns@gmail.com',
      url = 'https://github.com/peterldowns/mypackage',	# use the URL to the github repo
      download_url = 'https://github.com/peterldowns/mypackage/archive/0.1.tar.gz', # I'll explain this in a second
      keywords = ['testing', 'logging', 'example'], # arbitrary keywords
      classifiers = [],
    )

The `download_url` is a link to a hosted file with your repository's code.
Github will host this for you, but only if you
create a [`git tag`](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging). In your
repository, type: `git tag 0.1 -m "Adds a
tag so that we can put this on PyPI."`. Then, type `git tag` to show a
list of tags — you should see `0.1` in the list. Type `git push --tags origin
master` to update your code on Github with the latest tag information. Github
creates tarballs for download at `https://github.com/{username}/{module_name}/archive/{tag}.tar.gz`.

*Thanks to [Lars Blumberg](https://github.com/larsblumberg) for writing in about Github's current archive URL scheme.*

#### setup.cfg

This tells PyPI where your README file is.
		
    [metadata]
    description-file = README.md

This is necessary if you're using a markdown readme file. At upload time, you
may still get some errors about the lack of a readme — don't worry about it.
If you don't **have** to use a markdown README file, I would recommend using
[reStructuredText (REST)](http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html) instead.
	
#### LICENSE.txt

This file will contain whichver license you want your code to have. I tend to
use the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
	
### Upload your package to PyPI Test

Run:

    python setup.py sdist upload -r pypitest

This will attempt to register your package against PyPI's test server and make sure you've
set up everything correctly.

You should get no errors, and should also now be able to see your library in the
[test PyPI repository](https://testpypi.python.org/pypi).

### Upload to PyPI Live

Once you've successfully uploaded to PyPI Test, perform the same steps but point to
the live PyPI server instead. 

    python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi

and you're done! Congratulations on successfully publishing your first package!
